## Why?

This project started as a way for me to learn angular.js, we actually found it very useful for parties at the office and it became our own little office plaything.
I haven't touched this project in a few years and thankfully it still works with no maintenance. So this 2018 I wanted to learn something aside from React, and decided to 
rewrite jkbx in Vue. Enjoy!
